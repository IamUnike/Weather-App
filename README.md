# Weather-App

In this project, I explored the Weatherapi API to create a weather app with the following features:

1. Ability to check the weather information of any city in the world
2. Weather information includes the date, time and and geographical info of the city. 
3. Chance of rainful, precipitation, humidity and also a 24 hour forecast is also available
